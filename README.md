# EANConstruct

EAN barcodes creation tool for Mac OS 7-9. Written in 1997.

This utility generates these types of EAN barcodes:

* EAN-A
* EAN-D
* EAN-E
* EAN-EM

I don't have a clue how a Symantec THINK C project and resources could be uploaded somewhere outside the old Macintosh system, so building this code could be an ass pain.
