# EANConstruct

EAN barcodes creation tool for Mac OS 7-9. Written in 1997.

This utility generates the following types of EAN barcodes:

* UPC Version A
* EAN-13
* EAN-8
* UPC Version E

I don't have a clue how a Symantec THINK C project and resources could be read and uploaded outside the old Macintosh system, so building this code is supposed to be an ass pain.
